# Vita - Sustainable Energy Planning Application
Vita is a cross-platform application that simplifies the planning and implementation of sustainable energy projects, specifically solar farms. With Vita, users can quickly assess the feasibility of building a solar farm in any location, estimate energy output, and identify suitable land.

## Key Features:
* Feasibility Analysis: Determine the viability of a solar farm in a specific location based on factors like solar irradiation, land availability, and energy requirements.

* Monthly Global Horizontal Irradiation (GHI) Values: Access the GHI value for each month, providing crucial information about solar irradiation levels throughout the year.

* Energy Estimation per Panel: Calculate the estimated energy generated per panel, helping users understand the potential energy production capacity of their solar farm.

* Panels Needed Calculation: Input desired energy requirements or available land area to determine the number of panels needed to meet the specified energy goals.

* Land Identification: Identify suitable land for solar farm installations by analyzing factors such as availability, terrain characteristics, and other relevant parameters.
* Cross-Platform Compatibility: Vita is available on both Android and iOS devices, providing seamless access across platforms.
